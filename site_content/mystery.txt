<p>Wow, this was unexpected, huh? Pretty stinking cool!</p>

<!-- Note: the < and > characters MUST be specified by their HTML ASCII equivalents in order to render properly. Word to the wise! -->
<ul>
  <li>This is a bullet.
  <li>The bulleted list is created with an element called "ul".
  <li>Each bulleted item is created with an element called "li".
  <li>The "li" element does NOT require a close, but the "ul" element does.
  <li>This is another bullet.
  <li>One more, just for posterity.
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>This is an ordered list.
  <li>Instead of creating it with an element called "ul", it's created with an element called "ol".
  <li>Numero tres
  <li>My quads are ripped
  <li>The quintessential item
</ol>
